# Knight.io - State your purpose

Knight.io is the place for you developer to find the right 'x' for your purpose:

	'x':
	- Rubygem
	- Rails Plugin
	- Javascript Package
	- jQuery Plugin
	- Github Repository

Knight.io's mission is to **organize all the great work hosted on Github and make it findable and accessible to the developer community.**

Have you ever
	- searched for a way to do 'x'
	- been unsatisfied with your findings
	- decided to spend several weeks implementing a trimmed down version yourself
	- all with the voice in your ear more and more drumming: *'This is so increadibly basic. So many people must already have been stumpling upon 'x', and someone must have found a good solution how to solve 'x'.'*

I'll just say: You are so fucking right!

There are millions of repos hosted on Github, most containing garbage (Have you ever written shitty code that improved quite a lot when you showed it to your friends? I guess so.). There are hidden gems however, a lot of them, more than you ever imagined, just waiting for you to be uncovered. When on the watch for how to solve 'x', Knight.io is the site to have an eye on.

We send Knight.io out into the world as a blank wiki. Every worthy person (that is proud owner of a Github account - &lt;ad&gt;Sign up for free!&lt;/ad&gt;) is asked to contribute their knowledge about what hidden Github gems there are that we might all want to know about. That Ruby Gem that just came out last week that let's you do 'x' in mindblowingly concise code, that Rails ActiveRecord Plugin that exposes this super easy API for tagging your model objects, or that incredibly cool Javascript project that lets you write more powerful CSS than ever while compiling it live in the browser in development. Yeah, that's stuff that matters to all of us in the developer community. We ask you this, and only this: Add your Insights to Knight.io. It will be worth a lot to a lot of us.

In the beginning Knight.io will target: Ruby Gems and Rails Plugins; Javascript Projects, jQuery Plugins and Node Packages.

Knight.io is itself an Open Source webapp, its code hosted on Github. I myself am fairly new to programming, and founded Knight.io to serve my own needs. I spend a lot of time looking for the right tool for the job, now it should come to me.

How does Knight.io differ from 'x'?
	- The Ruby Toolbox: I quite like it. However it takes quite long for projects to get in and even longer for them to get out if they are deprecated. I find myself confronted needing to filter out stuff that As well it seems that their rating mechanism differs from what I need and look forward to find.

Inspiration:
	- [The Ruby Toolbox](http://ruby-toolbox.com)
	- [Toolbox.no.de](toolbox.no.de)
	- The many sites highlighting selected great jQuery Plugins
	- anyone who has tried to make the mannifold possibilities accessible to me. Thanks!

What should Knight.io look like? Any thoughts? Any ideas? Even feeling an urge to step in? - Do it. Open an issue, tweet it, share it. Thanks.

The future of Knight.io lays in your hands. Use it, and use it wisely.
