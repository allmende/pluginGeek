[pluginGeek](http://www.plugingeek.com) is your web development toolbox, reimagined.

### Why?

You're a great web developer! Builing stuff is your passion. But building houses with bare sand is not your style? Then pluginGeek might be for you. 

pluginGeek is your web development toolbox, reimagined. We list and categorize the latest gems and plugins in and for several web-related languages, including [Ruby]() and [Javascript](). These plugins can help you build more easily maintainable, high-quality web applications, in a shorter amount of time. Get a glimpse of what our favorite gems with the listed staff picks, and choose your dependencies wisely.

### How?

pluginGeek is an open-source Rails wiki on the state of the art gems and plugins in a few different, web-related programming languages and realms. We cover [Ruby gems](http://www.plugingeek.com/ruby), [Javascript and jQuery plugins](http://www.plugingeek.com/javascript), repositories related to [Webdesign](http://www.plugingeek.com/webdesign) as our web development categories from the start. If you're a mobile developer, you can boost your apps with the latest [iOS](http://www.plugingeek.com/ios) and [Android](http://www.plugingeek.com/android) libraries. Find what you look for in an instant, and if you know about other noteworthy repositories and links related to any available or new category, just add them. pluginGeek is a wiki, by the people and for people. Thanks! 

### Inspirations and alternatives

pluginGeek is certainly not the first of its kind. I've drawn a lot of inspiration from great sites including the [Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/), the phenomenal [Unheap](http://www.unheap.com/), and many more sites. Occasionally I cross-reference the inventory to make sure you'll always find the latest gems and plugins right at your hand.

### Technology

pluginGeek is Rails app fueled by a lot of [amazing gems](https://github.com/thomasklemm/pluginGeek/blob/master/Gemfile). The staging and [production apps](http://www.plugingeek.com) are deployed to [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), one of my favorites services for developers.

### Testing

pluginGeek uses [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) flavored with [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers). [Fabrication](http://www.fabricationgem.org/) helps with replacing fixtures and generating test objects. [Timecop](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop) makes time-related testing easy. [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) helps with recording and replaying external HTTP requests.  [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) powers the feature specs.

In all the current test suite holds more than 700 examples and runs in about 35 seconds on a standard MacBook Pro of 2010.

### Stats

### Learning

pluginGeek's source is intended to be nicely readable and comprehensible even if you are just getting started with Ruby on Rails development. There's a variety of annotations guiding you around.

For me, modeling an app alongside the original author's source has been and still is a great way of learning skills and style in a short amount of time. Feel free to draw as many inspiration from pluginGeek as you can.
