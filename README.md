[pluginGeek](http://www.plugingeek.com) is your web development toolbox, reimagined.

### Why?

Many of you who read this might be web developers, as I am. We're constantly facing demands an what to achieve next, and often could be helped quite a lot in our daily job by finding the best resources and plugins to ease our pain right away. You remember that nice gem you stumbled upon two weeks ago, with the blueish website. What was it called again?! 

### How?

pluginGeek is an open-source Rails wiki on the state of the art gems and plugins in a few different, web-related programming languages and realms. We cover [Ruby gems](http://www.plugingeek.com/ruby), [Javascript and jQuery plugins](http://www.plugingeek.com/javascript), repositories related to [Webdesign](http://www.plugingeek.com/webdesign) as our web development categories from the start. If you're a mobile developer, you can boost your apps with the latest [iOS](http://www.plugingeek.com/ios) and [Android](http://www.plugingeek.com/android) libraries. Find what you look for in an instant, and if you know about other noteworthy repositories and links related to any available or new category, just add them. pluginGeek is a week, by the people and for people. Thanks! 

### Inspirations and alternatives

pluginGeek is certainly not the first of its kind. I've drawn inspiration from a lot of great sites including the [Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/), the phenomenal [Unheap](http://www.unheap.com/), and many more sites. Occasionally I cross-reference the inventory to make sure you'll always find the latest gems and plugins right at your hand.

### Care about technology?

pluginGeek is Rails app fueled by a lot of [amazing gems](https://github.com/thomasklemm/pluginGeek/blob/master/Gemfile). The [production app](http://www.plugingeek.com) is deployed on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), one of my favorites services for developers.

It's certainly not the most complex app ever, and a variety of annotations should help people just starting with web development - as I about one and a half years ago - find their way around and learn from some existing code really quickly. Modeling an existing app on my own alongside the original author's source has been fruitful for me in picking up new skills, best practices and general coding techniques.
