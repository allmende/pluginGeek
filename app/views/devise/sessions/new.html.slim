    **pluginGeek** is a wiki, and you can make it awesome
    by contributing your know-how. The only thing you need
    to do beforehand is **signing in with Github**. <br />
    We'll only ask for your public profile infos during
    this process, and never have access to any repos,
    especially none of your private repos.
