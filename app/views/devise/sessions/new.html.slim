    **Plugingeek**, as a Wiki, flourishes by your contributions.
    In order to participate, you can **sign up and login
    through Github**. We don't retrieve and store any
    more information than nescessary to allow Plugingeek
    to work smoothly and store individual contributions
    to Plugingeek.

    Only information that is publicly displayed on your
    Github page can be accessed and may be stored by
    Plugingeek. This for sure excludes any information
    about private repos. We do not ask for any permission
    to access any of your private information, so Plugingeek cannot access it. If you have any further questions regarding the privacy of your data, please email me.

    **Thanks for your time and contributions!**
